# CHANGELOG

0.098  Add licensing for upload to interwebs.
0.097  Make logging path portable (albeit still unixy for now)

0.094  Validate timestamp format returned by collector.
0.093  Cleanup layout to appease PEP8 and Pylint.
0.092  Automatically duplicate error logging to stderr to avoid explicit print calls.
0.091  Try to reset relay states on errors/stale data, where appropriate.
0.090  Security: replace 'su' with native priv drop. All collectors now "nobodies" and shells aren't invited.
0.081  Decrease startup time by nesting optional dependencies.
0.080  Split code into several files.
0.071  Handle HTTP exceptions.
0.070  Rewrite in Python 3; no more 3rd party dependencies.

0.051  For simplicity, pins are now modified in order, rather than explicitly passed to functions as arguments.
0.050  Integrate PVOutput API.
0.040  Integrate Enlighten API; first practical version.
0.030  Now integrates with broadcom 2835 library and is changing GPIO states on the Pi.
